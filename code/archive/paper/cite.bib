abstract="Nowadays, an average tourist plans a vacation using web sites, magazine articles and guidebooks. The inability to modify this holiday plan in real-time motivates the need for a NextGeneration Mobile Tourist Guide (MTG). The MTG, a handheld embedded device, is aware of the tourist's preferences, attraction values and trip information. Based on real-time and reliable data, the device can immediately suggest new integrated holiday plans. To develop theseholiday plans, additional OR research and very specific decision models are required. In this paper, the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP)is defined as an extension of the Orienteering Problem (OP).",

abstract = {Abstract Geographic services based on GPS trajectory data, such as location prediction and recommender services, have received increasing attention because of their potential social and commercial benefits. In this study, a Geographic Service Recommender Model (GSRM) is proposed, which loosely comprises three essential steps. Firstly, location sequences are obtained through a clustering operation on GPS locations. To improve efficiency, a programming model with a distributed algorithm is employed to accelerate the clustering. Secondly, in order to mine spatial and temporal information from the cluster trajectory, an algorithm (MiningMP) is designed. Last but not least, the next possible location to which the user will travel is predicted. An integrated framework of GSRM could then be constructed and provide the appropriate geographic recommendation service by considering location sequences as well as other related semantic information. Experiments were conducted based on real GPS trajectories from Microsoft Research Asia (182 users within a period of five years). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our proposed GSRM model is effective and efficient at predicting locations and can provide users with personalized smart recommendation services in the following possible position with excellent performance in scalability, adaptability, and quality of service.}

abstract="Multi-step vehicle trajectory prediction has been of great significance for location-based services, e.g., actionable advertising. Prior works focused on adopting pattern-matching techniques or HMM-based models, where the ability of accurate prediction is limited since patterns and features are mostly extracted from historical trajectories. However, these methods may become weak to multi-step trajectory prediction when new patterns appear or the previous trajectory is incomplete.",

They can be employed to reveal the tourists¡¯ preference on landmarks and routings of tourism. Most of existing works on routing searches are based on the trajectories of GPS-enabled devices¡¯ users. From a distinct point of view, we attempt to propose a novel approach in which the basic unit of routing is separate road segment instead of GPS trajectory segment. In this paper, we build a recommendation system that provides users with the most popular landmarks as well as the best travel routings between the landmarks. By using Flickr geotaggged photos, the top ranking travel destinations in a city can be identified and then the best travel routes between the popular travel destinations are recommended. We apply a spatial clustering method to identify the main travel landmarks and subsequently rank these landmarks. Using machine learning method, we calculate the tourism popularity of the road in terms of relevant parameters, e.g., the number of users and the number of Point-of-Interests. These popularity assessments are integrated into the routing recommendation system. The routing recommendation system takes into consideration both the popularity assessment and the length of the road. The best route recommended to the user minimizes the distance while including maximal tourism popularity. Experiments were conducted in two different scenarios. The empirical results show that the recommendation system is able to provide the user good travel planning including both top ranking landmarks and suitable routings in a city. Besides, the system offers user-generated semantic information for the recommended routes."

The proposed recommender system provides personalized suggestions about touristic points of interest. The system generates recommendations, consisting of touristic places, according to the current position of a tourist and previously collected data describing tourist movements in a touristic location/city. The touristic sites correspond to a set of points of interest identified a priori. We propose several metrics to evaluate both the spatial coverage of the dataset and the quality of recommendations produced. We assess our system on two datasets: a real and a synthetic one.
