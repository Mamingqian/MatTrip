## Source Code for the Paper "Encoder-Decoder Based Route Generation Model for Flexible Travel Recommendation" published in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing.

The corresponding code is organized as:

model.py for the main part of our Bi-LSTM model, train.py for model training. generator.py, generator2.py, and generation.py for grid beam search evaluation on the test set and plot.py for plotting real planned routes on the map.

If there's any question, feel free to open an issue to discuss about it.
